# Handwriting Recognition Model For Words
**Handwriting Recognition Model**
**Overview**:

This project aims to develop a robust handwriting recognition system for digitization of handwritten text . The model is built using a hybrid of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, trained on  dataset. The system utilizes CRNN with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss for efficient sequence learning without explicit segmentaion or other traditional processes.

**Why Handwriting Recognition?**

Handwritten text recognition is essential for automating the processing of handwritten documents, which often contain crucial information. By converting handwritten data into digital format, it enhances the efficiency of documentation and this project is a sall contribution to that.

**How It Works:**

CNNs are used to extract features from handwritten text images, capturing patterns like edges and curves.
RNN-LSTM layers capture the sequential nature of handwriting, learning dependencies over time.
The model processes 4D tensors (batch size, image height, width, channels) for input images and outputs a sequence of characters.
CTC loss function helps the model predict sequences of text without requiring explicit segmentation.

**Technologies Used:**

TensorFlow & Keras for model building, training, and evaluation.
This project demonstrates the power of deep learning for real-world applications, improving the efficiency and accuracy of text recognition in complex environments.
